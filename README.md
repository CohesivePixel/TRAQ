## NodeJS program for crawling song metadata and writing it into the ID3 tag

This program takes in the filename of a set of given .MP3 files and crawls the metadata of the song contained in the MP3 file (associated by filename). After having found the song on Spotify it downloads the song metadata and writes it into the ID3 tag of the .MP3 file
